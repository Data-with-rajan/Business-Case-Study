# 🚚 Delhivery Feature Engineering Case Study

## 📋 About Delhivery
Delhivery is India's largest and fastest-growing fully integrated logistics provider. The company aims to build the operating system for commerce through:
- World-class infrastructure
- High-quality logistics operations
- Cutting-edge engineering and technology capabilities

## 🎯 Business Problem
The Data team needs to:
1. Process and understand data from engineering pipelines
2. Clean and transform raw data into useful features
3. Prepare processed data for forecasting model development

## 📊 Dataset Information

### Data Structure
The dataset (`delhivery_data.csv`) contains delivery logistics information including:
- Trip creation and execution details
- Route information
- Source and destination data
- Time and distance metrics

### Key Features
| Category | Features |
|----------|-----------|
| Time-based | trip_creation_time, od_start_time, od_end_time |
| Location | source_center, destination_center, source_name, destination_name |
| Distance | actual_distance_to_destination, osrm_distance, segment_osrm_distance |
| Duration | actual_time, osrm_time, segment_actual_time, segment_osrm_time |
| Identifiers | route_schedule_uuid, trip_uuid |

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Value Treatment**
  - Identification of null values
  - Implementation of appropriate imputation strategies
  - Validation of treated data

- **Data Structure Analysis**
  - Examination of data types
  - Verification of data integrity
  - Assessment of data relationships

### 2. Feature Engineering

#### Location Features
- Extraction from destination_name and source_name:
  - City
  - Place code
  - State

#### Temporal Features
From trip_creation_time:
- Month
- Year
- Day
- Day of week
- Time of day

#### Distance and Duration Features
- Calculation of actual delivery duration
- Comparison metrics:
  - Actual vs OSRM time
  - Segment vs total metrics
  - Distance variations

### 3. Advanced Analysis

#### Statistical Testing
- Hypothesis testing between:
  - Actual and OSRM times
  - Segment and total metrics
  - Distance variations

#### Outlier Analysis
- Detection using:
  - IQR method
  - Visual analysis
  - Statistical methods
- Treatment strategies implementation

#### Feature Transformation
- Categorical encoding:
  - One-hot encoding for route_type
  - Label encoding where appropriate
- Numerical feature scaling:
  - MinMaxScaler
  - StandardScaler

## 📈 Analysis Steps

1. **Basic Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Analyze data structure
   - Merge related rows based on trip_uuid

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Location feature parsing
   - Temporal feature creation
   - Distance and time calculations

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Time difference analysis
   - Distance metric comparisons
   - Hypothesis testing

4. **Data Transformation**
   - Outlier detection and treatment
   - Feature encoding
   - Feature scaling

## 💻 Implementation

### Required Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats
```

## 📊 Expected Outputs
1. Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
2. Engineered feature set
3. Statistical analysis reports
4. Visualization outputs
5. Feature importance analysis

## 🎯 Success Metrics
- Data quality metrics
- Feature engineering effectiveness
- Statistical significance of findings
- Model readiness assessment

## ⚠️ Note
Due to data confidentiality, the actual dataset (`delhivery_data.csv`) is not included in this repository. The code and documentation provide implementation details that can be applied to the dataset when available.
