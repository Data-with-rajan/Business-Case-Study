# **Raw Problem**

### **Mindset**
- **Evaluation will be kept lenient**, so make sure you attempt this case study.  
- **Read the question carefully** and try to understand what exactly is being asked.  
- **Brainstorm a little.** If you’re getting an error, remember that **Google is your best friend**.  
- You can **watch the lecture recordings** or go through your lecture notes once again if you feel like you’re getting confused over some specific topics.  
- **Discuss your problems** with your peers. Make use of the Slack channel and WhatsApp group.  
- Only if you think there’s a major issue, **reach out to your Instructor** via Slack or Email.  
- **There is no right or wrong answer.** We have to get used to dealing with uncertainty in business. This is exactly the skill we want to develop.

### **Steps**
1. **Import the dataset** and perform **usual data analysis** steps like:
   - Checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset.
2. **Detect Outliers** using:
   - Boxplot or the `describe()` method (check differences between mean and median).
3. Analyze **effects of features** (e.g., marital status, age) on product purchased using:
   - Countplots, histograms, boxplots, etc.
4. **Represent Marginal Probability**:
   - Example: What percentage of customers purchased KP281, KP481, or KP781 (can use `pandas.crosstab`).
5. **Check correlation** among factors using:
   - Heatmaps or pair plots.

### **Key Questions**
